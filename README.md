# Braga Houseparent Tiny Home

The person who is responsible for the house will have their own private space, this mini-project is our quest to maximise it!

# Why? 💭 

The person (_or couple_) who will be responsible for (_running and safeguarding_) the house 
will _live_ in the house because that is the _only_ way they can _empathise_ with the community.


# What? 🏠 

The "**Houseparent _TinyHouse_**" (**HT**) is a Tiny House in a single room 
with _everything_ a person or couple could want/need.
It will include 3 distinct "zones": Sleep, Work & Relax. Features:
+ [ ] Double Bed
+ [ ] Wardrobe
  + [ ] Attic space for off-season and excess clothes (_see below_)
+ [ ] Ultra-comfortable 2-person sofa / chaise-longue
  + [ ] Reading Light
+ [ ] Desk
  + [ ] Comfortable Chair
  + [ ] Gas-mounted monitor (_visible from sofa_)
+ [ ] Electric Blackout Blinds for _complete_ darkness when sleeping.
+ [ ] Security Screen Displays the "Dashboard" for the house in realtime.
  As with our other info screens, this will have a PIR (motion) sensor so it will only turn on 
  in response to movement. This will both conserve energy and reduce light

> **Note**: the HMT will not have it's own private bathroom or kitchen (_as these are shared_)
we made a conscious decision to _not_ make the room "_en-suite_" as we feel this is both _wasteful_ in terms of space and means that the housemaster can (_will_) avoid seeing the shared bathrooms which they are responsible for ensuring are clean, tidy and in a good state of repair.

## Attic Space 😮 

In addition to the self-contained "Tiny House" (room) with a Double Bed, 
the HT will have permanent stairs to the attic with storage space, a "spare bed" (_for guests_)
and a _generous_ skylight will give plenty of natural light into both the attic space and the bedroom.

The HT's attic will be a _highly_ versatile and _personalizable_ space that the person/people 

# Who? 🦄 

The "Houseparent" is the person responsible for the house and all the people who live in it.
The person will need to be well organised and know how to both follow and _create_ instructions.
We will detail their responsibilities, chores, perks and compensation in a **_separate_ document**,
for now just understand that this person will _live_ in the house **full-time** and will need to have  _great_ living quarters with security, privacy and multi-functional space.

## Target "User": Young Professional on Career Break/Change 🤸‍♀️ 

The _end-user_ will be a member of the community 
who wants to level-up their learning, commitment and responsibility.
We will only _begin_ the search for the person in May 2019.
Meanwhile, Inês and I (Nelson) will be the ("_Alpha_") Houseparents.


## Designer, Builder and Tester: Me 👨‍🎨 

I will be doing _all_ the design work from scratch / first principals.
I feel that I have accumulated enough furniture making skills/practice to take on the challenge.
I've watched _most_ of the Tiny House videos on YouTube and feel that I have a _really_ good idea 
of what I'm going to build.

> **Note**: everything in the room will be _modular_ and _easily_ replaceable/upgradeable,
so if something does not "_work_" during user-testing (_us living there_) we can _easily_ swap it out!

# When? 📆 

This will be the **_first_ room** I will work on in the house _after_ the first [**bunk-bed**](https://github.com/nelsonic/bunk-bed) is complete. 

# _How_? 👷 

+ [ ] 1. Take Detailed Measurements
+ [ ] 2. Gather Requirements
+ [ ] 3. Prepare preliminary 3D sketch in [SketchUp](https://github.com/nelsonic/nelsonic.github.io/issues/608) (_screen recorded_)
+ [ ] 4. Get _initial_ (_user_) feedback for 3D Render from Inês and anyone `else` _interested_ in this!
+ [ ] 5. Create Maslow CAD (_G-Code_) 2D drawings for each item of furniture. 
+ [ ] 6. Cut
+ [ ] 7. Assemble
+ [ ] 8. Install
+ [ ] 9. Test
+ [ ] 10. Edit and upload the videos!!

# Goal? 🎯 

My ultimate goal with this mini-project is to create an Open Source design for _everything_ in the room/house with a "***making of***" **video** from CAD, to Maslow, to Assembly and User Testing.

I will get as much "B Roll" as possible and make it available to others for their videos.

# _Plan_ 🗺 

My Plan is to go through the "How?" steps above and get as **_much_ footage** as possible for each step.
